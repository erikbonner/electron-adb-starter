# Electron ADB Starter

## Overview
This project can be used as the starting point for a collecting common adb commands and scripts and making them conveniently accessible via a UI. 

Based on the [Electron React Boilerplate](https://github.com/electron-react-boilerplate) repository.

## Technologies used

* [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [React MUI](https://mui.com/) on the frontend
* [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) on both frontend and backend (render + main processes)
* [ElectronJs](https://www.electronjs.org/) and [electron-builder](https://www.electron.build/) to build and package the app as a standalone executable
